intune deployment plan 

configure workloads appropriate for groups/
A workload is simply a sub-area of a service.

leveraging compliance policies from intune, require:

    An Intune and an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium subscription
    Devices running a supported platform
    Devices must be enrolled in Intune
    Devices that are enrolled to either one user or no primary user.
 
add apps based on platforms to intune (company portal, outlook, etc)
assess app requirements - should focus on the mobile application management for BYOD
- apps can be assigned to user groups from within intune - apps can come from app stores, M365, or be custom written

Use a phased approach. Start with a small group of pilot users, and add more groups until you reach full scale deployment.

Monitor the helpdesk load and enrollment success of each phase. Leave time in the schedule to evaluate success criteria for each group before migrating the next group.

Your pilot deployment should validate the following tasks:

    Enrollment success and failure rates are within your expectations.

    User productivity:
        Corporate resources are working, including VPN, Wi-Fi, email, and certificates.
        Deployed apps are accessible.

    Data security:
        Review compliance reports, and look for common issues and trends. Communicate issues, resolutions, and trends with your help desk.
        Mobile app protections are applied.
